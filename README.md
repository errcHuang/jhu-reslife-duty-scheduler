# JHU ResLife Duty Scheduler
This program is designed to facilitate duty scheduling for JHU Reslife. If you want to use it for some other purpose, go ahead! Feel free to use and modify this program as you see fit. 

### Installation 
To use this program you need to have Python 2.7+ installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
You also need to clone or download this repo. 

### Creating a Schedule
1. Create an input text file with the format
	```
    	person1 | day_of_week1, day_of_week2, ... | date1, date2, ...
    ```
    day_of_weekN is the day of the week when person1 can't do duty (ie monday, tuesday, etc)
    dateN is a specific date where person1 can't do duty (format MM/DD/YYYY) (ie 01/10/2018)

    Example:
	```
	    John | Monday | 02/14/2018, 03/01/2018, 05/01/2018
	    Jill | Tuesday, Wednesday | 04/10/2018, 05/13/2018
	```
2. Save the input file as a text file (someFile.txt) in the same place that you've cloned / downloaded this repo.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the place where you've cloned / downloaded this repo and type:
	```Bash
	    $ python scheduler.py --infile someFile.txt
	```
    The program should output the total number of weekday and weekend assignments for each person and any days where a conflict couldn't be easily resolved.  
	You can also specify the name of the output file (by default is schedule\_out.txt) via:
	```Bash
		$ python scheduler.py --infile someFile.txt --outfile someOutput.txt
	```

	__If you're using this tool past Spring 2018 you can enter new start and end dates both for the semester and for major breaks (Thanksgiving / Spring)__

	For example, the command to generate a schedule for Fall 2018 may look like:
	```Bash
		$ python scheduler.py --infile someFile.txt --outfile someOutput.txt --start-date 8/25/2018 --end-date 12/21/2018 --break-start-date 11/17/2018 --break-end-date 11/25/2018
	```
	If you need help with the commands you can type:
	```Bash
		$ python scheduler.py --help
	```
	__Note__: Each of the commands above has a less verbose version. In order they are:
	```Bash
		$ python scheduler.py -i someFile.txt
		$ python scheduler.py -i someFile.txt -o someOutput.txt
		$ python scheduler.py -i someFile.txt -o someOutput.txt -s 8/25/2018 -e 12/21/2018 -bs 11/17/2018 -be 11/25/2018
		$ python scheduler.py -h
	```
4. If the program ran with no errors a file (someOutput.txt) should have been generated with a randomized duty schedule based on the restrictions given in someFile. 

__Note__: This program isn't perfect. It uses a lot of randomness to generate the schedule and as such it may not always give the best solution or be able to resolve every day. If you find the schedule isn't particularly balanced on the first try, run it a few more times and select the best output. You can also manually edit the text file before commiting to Google Calendar. 

### Commiting a Schedule to Google Calendar 
To commit a schedule to Gogle Calendar you need:
1. A Google account
2. Edit access to the google calendar you want to update / commit to.
3. The Calendar ID for the google calendar you want to update / commit to. You can find this in the Calendar Settings. 
4. A schedule file in the __exact__ format as those generated by this program (see above). That is the file should be of the form:
```
<day of week> : <name> : <date in YYYY-MM-DD format>
```
For example 
```
thursday : John : 2018-02-15
friday : Jill : 2018-2-16
```
5. A Google Calendar API Key. (Eventually I'll try to package this so you don't have to do that, but as of now this is the best I can do.) Follow the steps here: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python to get your own Google Calendar API key. Make sure you move the `client.json` file to the same folder as `scheduler.py`. 
Once you've generated a schedule (see above) you can commit it to google calendar using:
```Bash
	$ python scheduler.py --commit --infile schedule_file.txt 
```
Or
```Bash
	$ python scheduler.py -c -i schedule_file.txt
```
The commands above will eventually prompt you to enter a Google Calendar ID. You can also enter the Google Calendar ID as a command line flag
```Bash
	$ python scheduler.py -c -i schedule_file.txt -c -cal <CALENDAR ID>
```
Where `<CALENDAR ID>` is the calendar ID copied from the Calendar Settings. 

### Analyzing a Schedule
If you've manually created or changed the schedule you may want to verify you still meet the RAs' preferences and that the number of weekday / weekend duties are balanced. The `analyze.py` program has a few features that will help with this. 
```Bash
	$ python analyze.py -cr -pf preferences_file.txt -sf schedule.txt
```
Checks that the schedule in `schedule.txt` conforms to the restrictions found in `preferences_file.txt`. If not, it will print the dates of any errors.
```Bash
	$ python analyze.py -gs -sf schedule.txt
```
Prints a summary of weekday / weekend duties for each RA based on the schedule in `schedule.txt`. 
```Bash 
	$ python analyze.py -cr -gs -pf preferences_file.txt -sf schedule.txt
```
Does both of the tasks above. 

### Issues or Updates
If you spot some kind of bug you can approach me directly or open an issue on github.

### To Do
* Look at two-back conflicts.
* Create GUI (wxPython, flask, tkinter, etc).
* Create option for dynamic input.
* Abstract for more general schedules.
